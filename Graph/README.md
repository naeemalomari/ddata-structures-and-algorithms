A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of Vertex and Edges.
## Challenge

To implement the Graph and Vertex class. Created instance methods for the Graph class: addVertex(), addEdge() , removeVertex(), removeEdge(), size(), printGraph(), getVertices(), getNeighbors().

## Approach & Efficiency
Efficiency Space o(n+2e)

## API

#### addVertex(): O(1)

* Adds a new Vertex to the graph
* Takes in the value of that Vertex
* Returns the added Vertex

#### addEdge(): O(1)

* Adds a new edge between two Verticesin the graph
* Takes in the two Vertices to be connected by the edge
* Both Vertices should already be in the Graph

#### getVertices(): O(n)

* Returns all of the Vertices in the graph as a collection.

#### getNeighbors(): O(n)

* Returns a collection of Vertices connected to the given Vertex
* Takes in a given Vertex

#### size(): O(n)

* Returns the total number of Vertices in the graph
