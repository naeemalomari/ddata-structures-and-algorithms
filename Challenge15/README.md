## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Big O for the binary search tree is log(n).

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
Pre-order: root >> left >> right
In-order: left >> root >> right
Post-order: left >> right >> root
